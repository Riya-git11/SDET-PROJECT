This project is a hybrid test automation framework built using Selenium with Java for frontend testing and RestAssured with Postman collection support for backend API testing.

UI Automation: Uses Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM) to validate UI elements, navigation, and workflows on Analytics Vidhya – DataHack website.

API Automation: Uses RestAssured to validate API responses, status codes, headers, and payloads.

Build & Execution: Managed with Maven, supports execution via command line or IDE.

Reports: Generates TestNG default reports, with options to integrate Extent/Allure reports.

Structure: Clearly separated into base/, pages/, ui/, and api/ packages for better maintainability.

Scalability: Supports regression, sanity, and integration with CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).


Setup Instructions
1️)Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automation-framework.git
cd automation-framework
